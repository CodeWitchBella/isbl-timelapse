# @isbl/timelapse

Render octolapse zip files into mp4.

## How to use

`npx @isbl/timelapse octolapse.zip`

Replace `octolapse.zip` with your filename.

## Dependencies

`ffmpeg` and `unzip` on your path. You also need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
and npm (usually installed with node). I also only tested this on linux, so no
idea if it works on windows/macos.
